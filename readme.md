  (p2) I want to be able to enter a word to be guessed by my opponent, so that the game can can begin
  I do not want to be able to see this word
  I want to be able to see the length of the word chosen by p2 without seeing the word
  I want to be able to guess a letter of the word (repeat)
  If the the letter is correct, I want it to be revealed in the word

  If I guess incorrectly too many times before solving the hidden word, i lose

  I want to be able to see a visualization of the incorrect guess I have made
  If the letter is incorrect, I want to add a hangman piece (point?)

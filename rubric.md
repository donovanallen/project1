# Rubric

## Deployment
Performing - App is fully deployed to gh-pages. Both local and deployed applications are sync'd

## Technical Requirements
Performing - You've met all technical requirements of the app. Great job! I would recommend looking at opportunities to refactor and abstract functionality.

## Code Quality
Performing - I love the comments you've made in your code. I would get rid of any commented out code and `console.log`'s from your production code. Code is properly formatted.

## Creativity/Interface
Performing - Really love the creativity in the drowning mechanism! That was really cool. Very clean interface. Although the buttons themselves don't work, i would consider allowing the option to click the buttons as well.
